            Behance, part of Adobe, is the leading online platform to showcase & discover creative work. 
            Creative people around the world join Behance, entering a community made with their original work and creative process in mind. Here, users showcase their work in the form of profiles comprised of Projects. 
            A Project is a grouping of images, videos, and other digital content with a related theme or process. Every project has a unique URL that can be shared across the web, as well as a View and Appreciation counter so you can track how many people have seen your project and given you kudos on a job well done. Here is an example of a Project created by the Behance Design Team.
